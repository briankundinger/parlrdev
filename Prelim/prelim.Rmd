# Introduction to Record Linkage

# Fellegi and Sunter

# Notation

- File A with records indexed $i \in \{1, \ldots, n_A\}$ and file B with records $j \in \{1, \ldots, n_B}$. We use $F$ features for linkage, with $L_f$ possible levels of agreement on feature $f$.

- $\Gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{n_A n_B \times F}$ matrix of comparison vectors

- $Z_j$

- $m_{fl} = P\left(\gamma_{ij}^f = l |Z_j = i\right)$

- $u_{fl} = P\left(\gamma_{ij}^f = l |Z_j \neq i\right)$

- $\lambda = P(Z_j \leq n_A)$
