\item BK: Follow the outline of Chen et al. (2018) regarding how an AoAS paper should be written given the Sadinle (2017) is written in a pretty methods based way. Sadinle (2014) is much more applied and what AoAS and JASA ACS like to see for an applied paper.

\section{Introduction}

Some keys references that you'll want to address:

\cite{sadinle_detecting_2014, sadinle2017bayesian} are both methods of Sadinle. The most seminal method in probabilistic record linkage is that of \cite{fellegi1969theory}. 

\subsection{Prior Work on Bipartite Matching for Record Linkage}

You only want to cite prior work on bipartite matching for record linkage in this section, so make sure to avoid my work as it's not comparable. You could mention it briefly given that it's been recently done, but that it would not fall under this framework. You would also want to mention that the first peer reviewed case study to our knowledge was done by Sadinle. 

\subsection{The El Salavoran Conflict} 

Talk about the data very simply. 

\subsection{Our Contributions}

Outline your contributions. You might outline them from now regarding the fact that they can change. 


\section{The Fellegi Sunter Method}

Needs to be reviewed and explained as Sadinle did in his 2017 paper. This should set out notation that you use for the rest of the paper. 

\section{Bayesian Bipartite Matching for Record Linkage}

Need to review Mauricio's method, which should help outline any shortcoming of his method and notation you want to use for the rest of the paper. 

\section{fabl: fast Bayesian Linkage}

Need to introduce your method in generality and explain your contributions. This is where you want things to be very powerful. You want to include proofs and showcase your work here. If you have insights moving forward --- then make sure to forward reference them. 

\section{Simulation Studies}
In this section, we provide two simulation studies. First, we provide a simulation study, where we XXX. Second, we provide a simulation study, where we XXX.
